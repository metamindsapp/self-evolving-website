# Self-Evolving Website

This project aims to create a website that autonomously evolves its design and content using artificial intelligence.

## Current Status

We have implemented the basic frontend structure of the Self-Evolving Website. The current features include:

- A simple, responsive user interface
- An "Evolve" button that triggers content changes
- A preview area to display the evolving content

## Features (Planned)

- AI-driven content generation
- Automatic design evolution
- Version history tracking
- User feedback system

## Technology Stack

- React (Frontend)
- Flask (Backend, to be implemented)
- Claude AI (Content Generation, to be implemented)

4. Start the development server: npm start

## Next Steps

- Implement backend logic using Flask
- Integrate Claude AI for content generation
- Connect frontend to backend for real-time evolution
- Enhance UI with more interactive elements and styling

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Flask (to be implemented)
- AI: Claude API (to be implemented)

## Contributing

This project is currently in development. Contributions, ideas, and feedback are welcome!

# Self-Evolving Website

This project creates a website that autonomously evolves its design and content using artificial intelligence.

## Current Status

We have implemented the basic structure of the Self-Evolving Website, including:

- A React-based frontend with a simple, responsive user interface
- An "Evolve" button that triggers content changes
- A preview area to display the evolving content
- A Flask backend with a basic API endpoint for content evolution
- Integration between the frontend and backend

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Real-time content evolution triggered by user interaction
- Server-side content generation (currently a placeholder, ready for AI integration)

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Flask (Python 3)
- AI: Claude API (to be implemented)

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory

3. Set up the frontend:
   ```
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

4. Set up the backend:
   ```
   pip3 install flask flask-cors
   python3 app.py
   ```

5. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Next Steps

- Integrate Claude AI for more sophisticated content generation
- Implement more complex evolution algorithms
- Enhance UI with additional interactive elements and improved styling
- Add user customization options for evolution parameters

## Contributing

This project is in active development. Contributions, ideas, and feedback are welcome!

This updated README reflects that:
1. The basic frontend and backend are now implemented and working together.
2. We're using Python 3 for the backend.
3. The project is now in a functional state with real-time updates from the server.
4. The next major step is integrating the Claude AI for content generation.
