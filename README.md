# Self-Evolving Website

This project aims to create a website that autonomously evolves its design and content using artificial intelligence.

## Current Status

We have implemented the basic frontend structure of the Self-Evolving Website. The current features include:

- A simple, responsive user interface
- An "Evolve" button that triggers content changes
- A preview area to display the evolving content

## Features (Planned)

- AI-driven content generation
- Automatic design evolution
- Version history tracking
- User feedback system

## Technology Stack

- React (Frontend)
- Flask (Backend, to be implemented)
- Claude AI (Content Generation, to be implemented)

4. Start the development server: npm start

## Next Steps

- Implement backend logic using Flask
- Integrate Claude AI for content generation
- Connect frontend to backend for real-time evolution
- Enhance UI with more interactive elements and styling

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Flask (to be implemented)
